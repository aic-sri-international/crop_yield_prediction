### Preprocess data and build histograms

#### Pre-processing the Data
`final_clean_data.py` will convert geotiff files to numpy files. This step is required prior to building the histograms.

#### Buidling Crop Histograms
`final_save_data.py` will build histograms based on the numpy files created in the pre-processing step.
