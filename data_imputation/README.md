### Preprocess data and build histograms

#### Pre-processing the Data
`process_data_for_histograms.py` will convert geotiff files to numpy files. This step is required prior to building the histograms.

#### Buidling Crop Histograms
`build_histograms.py` will build histograms based on the numpy files created in the pre-processing step.
